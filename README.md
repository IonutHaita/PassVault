# PassVault
 Little program that will turn your ESP32 into a personal passwords vault

This program was uploaded to my ESP32 via Arduino IDE and is curently in revision 1. Feel free to use your favourite IDE and further improve the code. Let me know what you think.

The device works while connected to the Bluetooth Terminal app.
